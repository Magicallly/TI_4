My name is Yoshikage Kira. 
I`m 33 years old. 
My house is in the north east section of morioh, 
where all the villas are, and i am not married. 
I work as an employee for the Kame Yu 
department stores, and i get home 
every day by 8pm at the latest. I dont smoke, 
but i occasionally drink. 
Im in bed by 11pm, 
and make sure i get eight hours of sleep, 
no matter what. 
After having a glass of warm milk 
and doing about twenty minutes 
of stretches before 
going to bed, 
i usually have no problems sleeping until morning. 
Just like a baby, 
i wake up without any fatigue or 
stress in the morning. 
I was told there were no
 issues at my last checkup. 
Im trying to explain that im 
a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. 
I take care not to trouble 
myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, 
that would 
cause me to lose sleep at night. 
That is how i deal 
with society, and i know 
that is what brings me happiness.
